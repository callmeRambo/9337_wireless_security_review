1. confidentiality:
2. authentication:
3. message integrity:
4. Non-repudiation:
## Public Key Cryptography
1. algorithms
KB- (KB+ (m)) = m
2. procedure
## Symmetric Key Cryptography( less computaionally than  public key)
Use one key(Session Keys) to encrypt and decrypt
1.  Bob and Alice use RSA to exchange a
symmetric key KS
2.  Once both have KS, they use symmetric key
cryptography
## Integrity
1. Hash/Message Digests (MD)--> (MD5, SHA-3)
large message -> Hash function -> H(m)
```
properties: 
– Easy to calculate
– Irreversibility: Can’t determine m from H(m)
– Collision resistance:
Computationally difficult to produce m and m’ such that
H(m) = H(m’)
– Seemingly random output
```
aVOID POOR digest: checksum not euqal.
## Basic Structure of SHA-1
## HMAC
APPENDING HASING AND SHARED SECRET TO COMPARE CONFIDENTIALITY. NO ENCRYPTION.
## Digital signature
```
cryptographic technique analogous to hand-written signatures:
• sender (Bob) digitally signs document, establishing he is document owner/creator.
• verifiable, nonforgeable: recipient (Alice) can prove to someone that Bob, and no one else (including Alice), must have signed document
```
Bob’s message, m -> Bob’s private key(Public key encryption algorithm) -> m,KB-(m)
### Difference with pulic key encryption: k-k+ and k+k-
#
#  Symemtric key ciphers and WLAN security
## 1. Block ciphers
```
- break plaintext message in equal-size blocks
- encrypt each block as unit
- used in many protocols (PGP-secure email, SSL(secure TCP), IPsec( secure net-transport layer))
```
1-to-1 mapping
etc: k = 3 then 000-> 110 and 111->001
<br> then it's 8! possibilities
<br> To prevent brute force, choose a large k.
## 2. Cipher block chaining( To prevent same cipher text)
sender creates a random k-bit number r(i) for ith block and calculates
### HOW TO RECOVER?
## OPERATES ON A SINGLE BLOCK OF PLAINTEXT: AES, DES
## problem:
1. identical blocks of plaintext produce identical blocks of ciphertext
2. no integrity checkes, can mix and match blocks
3. main use is short data.
## 3. Stream ciphers( long data)
1. process message bit by bit.
2. combine each byte of keystream with byte of plaintext to get ciphertext
etc: RC4(WIDELY USED IN WEP AND WPA)
## 4. WEP : PROVIDE SECURITY EQUIVALENT TO WIRED NETWORK
1. WEP pre-shared key(shared secret)
2. MAC PAYLOAD: IV + KEYID + DATA + ICV
## 5. WPA
